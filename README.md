# LSE-ST115-Final-Project
A data visualisation project with [@ethangoldo](https://github.com/ethangoldo)

### ü•Ö Goal: 
- To explore how the research of professors in the LSE Maths Department is related.

### ü§î How will we do this?
- By scraping the web pages for the four reseach areas, we can extract the relevant data.
- Then, we will use NLP to connect professors to each other.
- Finally, we visualise it in a graph.

### ‚ùì How can we measure differences between groups?
- By using metrics such as the [clustering coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient), we can measure the degree to which the nodes cluster together.
- We can also measure the [network density](https://www.the-vital-edge.com/what-is-network-density/) for each cluster to explore whether there is more potential collaboration in different areas.
